Cluster Computing 

it is a system in which a group of machines that are virtually or geographically separated and that work together to provide the same service
or application to clients and can be viewed as a single system.
The idea is that if any computer in a cluster crashes then the rest of the computers in the cluster can take over.

advantages:
1) user friendly
2) high availability of resources
3) elimination of single point of failure(which provides redundancy in the data access)

Disadvantages:
1) Not suitable for business and commercial purposes.
2) requires specialized knowledge of systems.

Grid Computing

it is a type of system that enables the sharing,selection and aggregation of resources distributed across multiple administrative domain.
They consist of:
1) Control Node
2) Provider
3) User
it contains features such as resource coordination which provides aggregated computing capabilities.

advantages:
1) They are modular.
2) They dont have single point of failure.

disadvantages:
1) Requires fast interconnect between it's resources.
2) May require large SMP.

Cloud Computing

it is a system that provides on-demand availability of computer resources and centrally managed distribution of public cloud services.
it works as a distributed system and has modular working.

advantages:
1) High Speed
2) Once data is stored in cloud,it is easier to get the back-up and recovery of that data.

Disadvantages:
1) chances of data being accessed by outsiders.
2) internet connectivity is required.
